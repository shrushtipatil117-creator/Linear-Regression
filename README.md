# Linear-Regression
Task 3-Linear-Regression |AI &amp; ML Internship-Elevate Labs.

## 📌 Objective
To implement and understand Simple & Multiple Linear Regression using Scikit-learn.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
## 📂 Dataset Used
California Housing Dataset (from sklearn library)

This dataset contains information about housing prices in California based on features like:
- Median Income
- House Age
- Average Rooms
- Population
- Latitude & Longitude
- etc.

## 🔄 Steps Performed
1. Imported required libraries
2. Loaded the dataset
3. Checked for missing values
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained Linear Regression model
6. Made predictions
7. Evaluated model using:
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
   - R² Score
8. Visualized actual vs predicted values
9. Interpreted model coefficients

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
 **MAE**: Measures average absolute errors.
- **MSE**: Penalizes larger errors.
- **R² Score**: Indicates how well the model explains variance.

## 📊 Results

The model successfully predicted housing prices with a reasonable R² score, showing that Linear Regression can effectively model housing price prediction.
